# Odin SDK for Python

ODIN's primary focus is to equip infosec teams with a precise depiction of the internet, enabling them to strengthen their security defences and proactively detect threats within their attack surface.


The Odin SDK for Python allows you to easily interact with the [Odin API](https://getodin.com) and access various cybersecurity services, certificate information, and more.

## Installation

To use the Odin SDK in your Python project, you need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install odin-sdk-python
```

**⚠️ Important Note for macOS Users:** We recommend using a newer version of the Python interpreter, such as the one installed via Homebrew, to ensure compatibility and avoid potential issues related to the legacy SSL library bundled with the default macOS Python interpreter.

## Examples

In the "example.py", you can find various usage examples demonstrating how to interact with the Odin API using the `odin-sdk-python` package.

Each example is a standalone Python program that showcases specific functionalities of the SDK.

```python
from odin import OdinClient, APIException

client = OdinClient("https://api.getodin.com/v1", "<APIKey>")

def ex_hosts_count():
    # Example for using get_hosts_count
    try:
        response = client.get_hosts_count("string")
        print(response.success)
        print(response.data.count)
        
    except APIException as e:
        print(e.status_code)
        print(e.message)
```

Make sure to replace `<APIKey>` with your actual Odin API key.
